## Concept 
Two players battle in a turn-based game using their voice. Using Watson Speech to text and Azure Text Analytics, the player that scores better based on their respective sentiment will deal damage to the other player.

## Setup 
- You will need to get Watson Speech to Text API keys and setup and endpoint for your Azure Text Analytics 
- In the GameLogic -> WatsonManager Script add in your API keys and your endpoint, add the Main Menu Scene to the Hierarchy, and press play to begin the game
